# Example application .NET 8 API Versioning
A small application because I always have to search how to setup API-Versioning.
This is a (relative) minimal setup to accomplish versioning?
ConfigureSwaggerOptions should always include all defined API-versions based on the [ApiVersion()] attribute

Suggestions are always welcome!
